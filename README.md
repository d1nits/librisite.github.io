This pet-project was created to practice the Django framework in web development. 
The website allows users to create and manage book reviews using basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
In addition to review management, users can create discussion threads on a forum to discuss books or ask book-related questions.
The platform also includes a “Book Collections” section, where users can create custom collections by selecting and grouping existing books based on a specific theme or personal preference, such as favorite books.
User interaction on the website is not available anonymously. To create reviews, participate in discussions, or manage book collections, users must first authenticate.
